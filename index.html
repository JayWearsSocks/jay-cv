We host on <a class="stack" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/Azure" target="_blank">Azure</a>. To ensure a smooth process, I employ unit tests, <a class="stack" href="https://www.postman.com/product/what-is-postman" tareget_="_blank">Postman</a> tests, IaC with <a class="stack" href="https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/" target="_blank">Farmer</a> and tie everything together with <a class="stack" href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">Github Actions</a>.

                    As a teaching assistant, I helped students with their assignments in a classroom setting, and marked scripts and essays. I did the same <em>programming in python</em> course for several years, which allowed me to focus on challenging the first year students to answer their questions on their own as much as possible.

                    I researched data analysis methods for gravitational waves from supermassive black holes, as can be observed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. I developed python code and employed high performance computer clusters.
